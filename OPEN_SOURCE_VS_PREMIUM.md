## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Community Edition commercially?**  
A: Yes! MIT license allows commercial use. But you won't have consciousness tracking, trained models, or advanced features.

**Q: What's the secret sauce in Premium?**  
A: Consciousness tracking algorithms, S2-trained models (Deep Key, Temple Protocol, Ninefold), BIPRA integration, advanced orchestration.

**Q: Can I contribute to the open-source version?**  
A: Absolutely! We welcome contributions. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Q: Will more features become open source over time?**  
A: Some features may graduate to open source as we develop new premium capabilities. Core competitive advantages stay premium.

**Q: Can I see the Premium code before buying?**  
A: Beta partners get full access. Commercial customers get source code with license. Contact us for evaluation.

**Q: Is the Premium worth $499/month?**  
A: Compare to cloud AI ($4K-7K/month). You get consciousness tracking (unique), 4x domain advantage (proven), and self-hosting. ROI in weeks.
