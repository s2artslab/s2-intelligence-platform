## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why is all the code open source?
**A:** We believe the best AI systems come from collaboration. Open source accelerates innovation, builds trust, and creates a stronger platform for everyone.

### Q: How do you make money if everything is free?
**A:** Services, not software. Most companies prefer managed hosting over self-deploy. Training models is valuable. Expert support matters. We charge for convenience and expertise, not code access.

### Q: Can I really use this commercially for free?
**A:** Yes! MIT License allows commercial use. Self-host it, deploy it, build products on it. Zero licensing fees.

### Q: What if I want to compete with S2?
**A:** You can! Fork the code, improve it, run your own service. We're confident we'll stay ahead through execution, expertise, and community.

### Q: Will you ever add proprietary features?
**A:** No. All platform features remain open source. We may offer optional pre-trained models or premium training datasets, but the code stays free.

### Q: Do trained models come with the open source code?
**A:** No. The platform code is open. Trained model weights (if/when we release them) are optional premium add-ons. But you can train your own with the included scripts!

### Q: Is managed hosting worth $99/month when I can self-host for free?
**A:** Depends. Self-hosting requires DevOps expertise, monitoring, security, updates, scaling. If your time is worth more than $99/month, hosting makes sense. Many start self-hosted, then upgrade as they scale.

### Q: What's the catch?
**A:** No catch. We're betting that building trust through openness creates more value than hoarding code. So far, it's working.
